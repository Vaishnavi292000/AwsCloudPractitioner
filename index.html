        <h4>EC2 Types</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                General Purpose : Instances in which compute, storage, memory all are balanced.
            </li>
            <li>
                Compute Optimized : Instances in which compute is high and other are balanced. 
                Ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors. 
                Like general purpose instances, you can use compute optimized instances for workloads such as web, application, and gaming servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Memory Optimized : Instance in which memory is priority. Designed to deliver 
                fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory. Use in which CPU 
                preload of application is high.
            </li>
            <li>
                Accelerated Computing : Instances use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, 
                to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. 
                Examples of these functions include floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, 
                and data pattern matching.
            </li>
            <li>
                Storage optimized : Instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read 
                and write access to large datasets on local storage. Examples of workloads suitable for 
                storage optimized instances include distributed file systems, data warehousing applications, 
                and high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
